# NUnit

"Production application can break with a simple change that was unexpected to alter any other functionality" Sounds familiar right?! 

Good news is, with well written unit test's this would be a thing of the past.

Automated testing has been a buzz word for a while but many times developers struggle to find a course that covers the fundamentals of unit testing while implementing what they learned in a real world project! That is the main focus of this course.

This course is all about writing effective unit tests using C# programming language and NUnit /XUnit as a unit testing framework. Along the way, we will learn the concepts related to unit testing. Today unit testing is an absolutely required skill from any professional developer. Companies expect from developers to know how to write unit tests using best practices. This course will help you setup a solid foundation with a real world example and how unit testing could be done in a .NET Core Web application with EF Core.



**What is unit testing?**

UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected.

**Why learn unit testing?**

Why should I learn unit testing? Why spend extra time to write code to test? Is manual testing not sufficient? 

These are pretty common questions and I will answer them all but most of the times manual testing is much more time consuming and it is not as through as unit test. Unit tests take time once to write and can be executed for free every time! 

As application grows, the cost of manual testing grows exponentially. And manual testing will never give 100% confidence with all the edge cases.. Automated tests help you to catch the bugs while it is in development phase, because of which they would be easier to resolve.



**Will it help me with job?**

Many times, skills comes with that will that skill help me achieve professionally. Unit testing is a very valuable skill with the current development cycle. It is a must have skill in most organizations for senior developers.



By end of this course you will have a solid foundation with unit testing. Along with a solid foundation we will implement what we learned in real world N-Tier web application with .NET 6 and EF Core.
